    "In the las lesson we have covered pandas in great lenght, and still, we have not even began to scratch the surface of what this powerful tool can do. Some of keypoints to take away from last lesson, and some of which will be reinforced again in this one, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pandas provides two fantastic data structures for data analysis, the DataFrame and the Series. Series are one-dimensional arrays that are similar to NumPy but with more functionalities. DataFrames are 2-dimensional data structures that allows to manipulate data with ease.\n",
    "- We can slice and dice these data structures to our hearts content but we have to keep in mind the inconsistencies that we might find in different datasets.\n",
    "- We should always begin by inspecting our dataset immediately after loading it into memory. pandas provides methods such as info, describe, and isna that work very well and allow us to look at the underlyiing information about the dataset.\n",
    "- Don't try to learn all the tools inside pandas but rather explore the ones you need as the need arises. You can also explore them slowly and build and practice with different datasets to build an intuition behind them."

    "Data visualisation, more than being part art and part science, is one of the key components of the data analytics cycle. People have different learning styles and to be able to convey information in a more accessible way, sometimes it is better to do so through visualisations rather than tables and written text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quote [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), a company making data visualisation more accessible to everyone, \"Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualization as a field of study has been on the rise for over many decades now --if not centuries-- and it is an exciting area to be a part of. Organisations such as the [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/), FreeCodeCamp, and others, have extensive information on how to go beyond simple data visualisation, should that be something that interests your. If you would like to read more about data visualisation and what you can do with it, check out this [medium site](https://medium.com/nightingale).\n",

    "Python has a wide variety of visualisation tools available for static and interactive, quantitative and qualitative, time series and geographic data visualisation, and some of the most-widely used libraries for these purposes, to date, are the following ones:\n",

    "- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) --> highly customisable and long-term contender in the dataviz arena\n",
    "- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) --> beautiful data visualisation library that is easy to use and fast\n",
    "- [bokeh]() --> great (and beautiful) tool for interactive data visualisation\n",
    "- [plotly]() --> bokeh's top contender\n",

    "When we get to the data visualisation stage of the data analytics cycle, we should always keep in mind the nature of the data we would like to visualise. If we want to see relationships (correlations between variables) we might only choose quantitative variables for our visualisations. If we want to show a specific theme in our dataset, e.g. gender differences, customer type, or potential customer, we might just opt for visualising frequencies in qualitative data. In contrast, if we want to show the relationship of variables given a specific group in our dataset (e.g. income differences by gender), we would choose a combination of qualitative and quantitative variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of choosing a combination of variables, this is often another good questions analysts tend to spend time on. Should we want to show one particular variable in isolation or a group of variables would depend on the context of the question at hand, and in which part of the data analytics cycle you as an analyst are on. For example, boxplots can be used extensively during the cleaning stage to detect outliers, and they can also be used during the presentation stage to showcase the distribution of some of your most important variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are aware of these subtle differences, how do we know which visualisation to pick? The answer is that it will depend on the context of your task, and on how much information you would like to convey in your visualisation. As you decompose a task to choose the best course of action for your visualisation, keep the following diagram in mind from ActiveWizards."

In the case of categorical data, we might want to show the frequency with which an event has happened in the past, for example, how many times did a customer go to the ice-cream shop last week in comparison to the previous one.

At the same time, the more data types you have, the broader the range of visualisations you can create. Geographical data, in particular, is perfect for using it in combination with other data types. See, for example, the map by Mike Bostock below, which shows the population of the United States by county.\n",

    "Who will be seeing or evaluating your visualisation? This point is crucial, if the visualisation is just for us to understand a specific part of our dataset, then we might not have to create it with as much detail as we would for an audience we were presenting information to. After all, we know this visualisation will only be seen by us. In contrast, if we create a data visualisation to help our boss evaluate a specific analysis, or for an audience of colleagues working on a particular project, we want to make it as easy as possible to understand the message we are trying to convey, and in the appropriate context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context is essential for clarity. If we are presenting a technical insight to a non-technical audience, the message and the presentation will need to be adjusted accordingly. The reach of our message sometimes is more important than the technical little details of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect to keep in mind is interactivity. As analysts, we should always ask ourselves, will our message reach our audience better if they were able to interact with the visualisation? The reason behind this can be captured in a very famous quote by Benjamin Franklin.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the reasons we don't want to get rid of missing data immediately is that we might not be able to tell upon first inspection whether the missing values are due to an error with data collection or simply an instance that doesn't exist. For example, imagine you own a retail store that sells clothes for all kinds of weather and that you have a general survey that you send out to all of your customers. If you were to ask a customer in Latin America about whether they like to wear fluffy coats or regular coats whenever is winter season, they will probably leave that section blank because they don't experience a change of weather significant enough to buy that type of clothing. Hence, the missing value is not due to an error but rather an accurate observation.\n",

One of the main reasons for its popularity is the extensive customisation capabilities of the plots one can build with it. Almost any chart you can think of, can be built with matplotlib. From 2D to 3D, frmo static to interactive, from statistical to geographical, and the list goes on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will focus on how to get started creating data visualisations with matplotlib. We will cover the building blocks of this versatile tool, give examples of several use cases, and explore some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind is that, we will be focusing on the `pyplot` module of matplotlib, so when we import matplotlib into our session, we will do so with its industry alias `plt`. For example, here are two ways for importing matplotlib's pyplot module to our session.\n",

    "Another common functionality we would like to take advantage of is, that of being able to see our plots inline (i.e. inside our notebook as images) once we plot them. To do this, we will be using `%matplotlib inline`. This statement is called a magic command, and these magic commands are calls within IPython that provide different functionaltities to either a particular cell, line of code, or the entire notebook. In the case of `%matplotlib inline`, a cell containing this call will only need to be run once and then we can move on to making plots to our heart's content, knowing they will appear normally in our notebook.\n",

We will introduce both ways in this tutorial, but will favor the object oriented approach beyond this lesson, as it allows for a higher degree of customisation.\n",

    "Let's visualise more data. Now, we will move on to scatter plots, which are a type of visualisation that allows us to see relationships between different variables. There are two ways of creating scatter plots in matplolib. One is by using `plt.scatter()` and the other is by using `plt.plot(x=, y=, 'o')`. Notice how the third parameter has no name, this is the way matplotlib deals with this functionality for plots. We will use `scatter` as it is more straightforward but the latter is more robust to large datasets, meaning, it handles large amounts of data better. This is because it does less computation behind the scenes. You can read more about this in the matplotlib's documentation."

    "For the second we will be assigning two objects that come out of the `plt.subplots()` method, a figure and an axes object. The figure controls everything related to size, saving, and manipulating the figure as a whole. The axes object allows us to control everything that goes into the figure such as the type of plot, how many, and which customisations we would like to see. You can think of the `fig` object as our container and the `ax` object as our data.\n",

    "- `plt.ylim()` --> `ax.set_ylim()`\n",

    "A very useful way of visualising data is by aggregating it first. It doesn't change the parameters or the way we would create a visualisation with the regular dataset, but rather it helps us create very concise plots. Let's create a quick pivot table to see how the humidity changed throughout the day during the years for which we have data."

    "Not super informative right? What we could do insted is to create four figures showing the distributions of temperatures across our dataset. To do this, we will pass in the shape of our figure to our `.subplots()` method, and select the index of each figure as if we were doing so in a matrix, with slicers in our `ax` parameters. We will also add to our `.subplots()` method, the `sharey=True` to let matplotlib know that we want our for figures to share the same y axis. The next step we will take is to add a `figsize=` parameter to our figure to tinker with the size of the end result.\n",

    "- Data visualisation is great for exploring our datasets\n",
    "- It allows us to see interesting patterns in the data that might not be visible upon first inspection\n",
    "- Before any data visualisation takes place, we need to clean and prepare our dataset\n",
    "- Satatic graphs are great for telling a story from one angle\n",
    "- Interactive visualisations are great for involving the audience with the message we are trying to convey\n",
