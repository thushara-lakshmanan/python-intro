In other words, it helps us estimate some degree of uncertainty in the future (something we don't know anything about).\n",

    "Another way for thinking about inferential statistics goes as follows. We have evidence about the characteristics of all of the observations in our sample, the true parameters of the population are unkown but we can approximate an answer to the true parameters if the sample is large enough. In this scenario, we would like to make an inference or educated guess about the truth. \n",

    "Statistical distributions are a tool to represent our dataset and a way to approximate reality. Distributions allow us to see how the likelihood or probability or different measurements (e.g., prices, weights, temperature, ect.) are distributed. The mountain or peak of a distributions show the most likely data points we will encounter, while the tails of a distribution let us see the most unlikely events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributions are usually visualised using histograms, and histrograms represent information or data by grouping each observation into bins. Aside from allowing us to visually inspect the data, histograms also give us a way to estimate how likely we are to find an observation taken at random, inside any of the bins. The more observations we gather about X phenomena, e.g. the more price per night data for new listings in our Airbnb dataset, the more spread out and smooth our histogram might become.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also able to pass curve through a histogram to show a smooth approximation of the data point to a given bin, and we can also represent the probability of seeing a data point that we don't have in our sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kind of distribution we have been referring to so far is that one where there is only one peak, and to an extent, only one shape. Because different distributions share different kinds of features, there are other types of distributions such as:\n",

    "### Discrete distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are discrete distributions where all outcomes are equaly likely (e.g. picking a card from a deck or rolling a die), these are said to follow a **Uniform distribution**.\n",
    "- Other discrete distributions, such as those that only have two potential outcomes, true or false, yes or no, follow what we call a **Bernoulli distribution**.\n",
    "- When we calculate many yes or no distributions and plot them on a graph, we have what is called a **Binomial distribution**.\n",
    "- There are also distributions that allow us to calculate the probability of very rare events, such as the **Poisson distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous distributions can be represented more easily by a curve as opposed to binned bars, and that is because the data point in such an array usually has float values (e.g. price per house, income, termperature, height, weight, etc.).\n",
    "- The most common distribution we see of the continuous kind is the **normal distribution**. Which is very closely represented by natural events such as precipitaion, snow measurements in inches, etc. Even though the of a normal distribution resembles well rounded mountain, we can often encounter many rare events called outliers, and we can also be presented with very little information about a phenomenon (e.g., there was very little evidence of COVID-19 prior to 2019). To represent different events with distributions, we have a few options\n",
    "- **Student's T distribution** is a special distribution that allows us to accommodate extreme values very well. Think of this distribution as a mountain with a smaller peak and fatter flat sides. The lower number of elements would make the occurance of the extreme values represent a higher population than they would otherwise\n",
    "- **Chi-Squared distribution** always contain non-negative numbers and also always asymmetric. This means that they don't have a typical mountain and will always start after 0 in the origin of any x-y coordinates. This distribution is very useful for hypothesis testing but it often lacks in its inability to truly represent reality.\n",
    "- **Exponential distributions** represent rapidely changing events such as epidemics or stock market crashes.\n",
    "- **Logistic or Sigmoid distribution** allows us to forecast different events and also determine the cut off point where an event happens. This distribution is oftern used in classification algorithms to tell us whether an image has a cat or a dog, and email is spam or not, or if we have rain or no rain.\n",

We will also want to know whether these questions hold true against the evience we currently have, and to do this, we turn to the inferential side of statistics to compare a variety of methods suitable for different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we assume the data we have comes from some type of real distribution in the actual population, hence, when we answer a hypothesis test we are doing so in terms of the whole population and not the sample from which the data was taken. Because of the large space of questions we can asks for different data, we will have different flavors of hypotheses **tests** to choose from. Before we move on, let's define what a hypothesis is in a general way.\n",

    "> \"A hypothesis is a question, premise, claim or idea that we want to test using data\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic elements of a hypothesis are\n",
    "- $H_{0}$ --> (pronounced H of not) is the Null Hypothesis or **the idea that we want to disprove.** You can also think of this as the status quo or what has already been accepted by the majority but not proven false yet.\n",
    "- $H_{A}$ --> (pronounced H of A) is the alternative hypothesis we want to test and hopefully prove right. It is also called the research hypothesis.\n",
    "- Statistical significance --> the measure or place where we draw the line to be able to say that our results are strong enough to disprove what is currently accepted.\n",
    "- Reject $H_{0}$ --> this is the result we get when we do find evidence against the status quo or accepted view or idea.\n",
    "- Fail to reject $H_{0}$ --> this is the result we get when we are unable to disproved the accepted idea.\n",
    "- Level of Confidence --> usually set to 95%. Is our degree of confidence in our decision. For example, if we are rejecting a null hypothesis we could say, \"I am 95% confident that rejecting the null hypothesis is a valid conclusion.\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ --> Is the level of significance of our decision. This is calculated by subtracting 95% from 1 (e.g. $\\alpha = 1 - 95%$ and it is the explicit threshold by which the probability we get from our result needs to be for us to make our decision. For example, the probability estimate generated from our hypothesis test has to be below 0.05 for it to be meaningful to us.\n",
    "- $p-value$ --> Is the probability or result we get from a hypothesis test. It allows to prove or dispruve our assumptions. The way we use p-values is by comparing this result with our level of significance $\\alpha$. In other words\n",
    "    - If $p-value > \\alpha$ we **fail to reject** the Null Hypothesis\n",
    "    - If $p-value < \\alpha$ we **reject** the Null Hypothesis. Another way of wording this: There is a 5% chance that two identical distributions would have produce the results we are observing.  \n",

    "Notice from the above statements that we can infer that no hypothesis is ever fully true just not proven false until something better comes up. Always keep this in ming as you move along your data analytics journey. Also, since in order test a hypothesis we will need past data, questions that lack data will have no foundation to be tested on. For example\n",

    "        - $H_{A}:\\mu_{0} \\neq 124.7$\n",
    "        - The two hypotheses above can be thought of as mathematical opposite questions.\n",
    "4. Which test do we need to use in order to test our hypothesis?\n",
