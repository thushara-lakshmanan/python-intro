    "[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library originally developed with the goal of making data manipulation and analysis in Python easier. The library was created by Wes McKinney, and it was first released in 2010. It has been designed to work with tabular data that does not necessarily, unlike NumPy, has to have the same kind of data type in a column or array. pandas gives you, in a way, the same capabilities you would get when working with data in tools such as Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets, but with the added benefit of allowing you to use more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, pandas allows you to finely-tune most of the computations you would like to apply to your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library is also mostly built on NumPy, this means that a lot of the functionalities that you learned in the previous lesson will transfer seamlessly to this lesson and this new tool we will explore. What you will find in pandas is, the ability to control your NumPy arrays as if you using a spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of pandas main characteristics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Straightforward and convinient way for loading and saving datasets of and into different formats, respectively\n",
    "- Swiss army knife for data cleaning\n",
    "- Allows for the broadcasting of operation, hence, if you can avoid loops... (üê≥, up to you)\n",
    "- Allows for different data types and structures inside its two main data structures, Series and DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas, like NumPy, also has a industry standard alias that we will be using throughout the course. This library is usually imported as `pd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like NumPy has the very efficient data structure called `ndarray`'s, pandas, as NumPy's child, has its own structures called `DataFrame`s (the equivalent of a NumPy matrix), and `Series` (the equivalent of a NumPy array). We will cover these two structures next.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** It is possible that the control boost you will feel as you begin to learn how to use pandas to clean, manipulate, and analyse data, will prevent you from going back to using the tools you have been using in the past (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets, regular calculators, etc.). üòé"

    "Before we are able to import data into Python from outside sources, we'll walk over how to transform existing data (i.e., data we will come up with it), into the two main data structures of pandas, `DataFrame`s and `Series`. We will do so through several different avenues, so let's first talk about what are `DataFrame`s and `Series`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pandas `Series` is the equivalent of a column in a pandas `DataFrame`, a one-dimensional numpy array, or a column or row in Excel. In fact, since pandas derives most of its functionalities from NumPy, you can tranform the type of a Series by applying the attribute `.values` on to it, and pandas will return a `numpy.ndarray`. A Series has most of the functionalities you will see in a `DataFrame` and they can be combined to form a complete one as well. Let's switch our attention to `DataFrame`s now.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `DataFrame` is a data structure particular to pandas that allows us to work with data in a tabular format. One of the best analogies for pandas' `DataFrame`s is that they allow us to manipulate data as if it were inside a spreadsheet. You can also think of a pandas DataFrames as a NumPy matrix with more flexibility. Some characteristics of `DataFrame`s are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- they have a two-dimesional matrix shape (but can also handle more dimensions)\n",
    "- their rows and columns are clearly defined with a visible indexes and names, respectivelt, when displayed\n",
    "- indexes are explicit and visible upon immediate inspection of the dataframe\n",
    "- they have a plethora of functionalities for reshaping, cleaning, and munging the data\n",
    "- Indexes can be strings, dates, numbers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first start by importing `pandas` with its industry alias, `pd`, and then checking the version we have installed in our machines.\n",
