    "Let's begin by summarising what we learned in lesson 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data types help us have a clear view of the information we are dealing with. They can be `int`, `string`, `float`, or `booleans`.\n",
    "2. Data structures allow us to hold information in different formats and in different ways. The data structures we have at our disposal are `dictionaries`, `tuples`, `lists`, and `sets`.\n",
    "    - Dictionaries are key-value pair data structures that can hold multiple bits of information for us and does not follow the same convension or strictness of other data types/structures and variables. Dictionaries are also mutable (a.k.a. the values they hold for us can be changed).\n",
    "    - Lists are the most versatile data structure in Python, they can hold all sorts of data types --and strucures-- and are also mutable.\n",
    "    - Tuples are lists cousins, but that they don't like change and are immutable.\n",
    "    - Sets are like tuples, except that sets don't like to hold two of the same data twice (i.e. they don't like to have duplicates).\n",
    "3. Variables are buckets that hold specific objects for us. They can only have letters, numbers, and underscores for their names. They cannot begin with a number, and they have to be followed by an equal (`=`) sign that represents assignment.\n",
    "4. There are several ways for printing in Python, and we will use all of these throughout the course.\n",
    "    - `print(f\"Something {cool}\")`\n",
    "    - `print(\"Something {}\".format(\"cool\"))`\n",
    "    - `print(\"This is cool too!\")`\n",
    "    - `print(\"This is even %s!\" % \"cooler\")`\n",
    "5. Math symbols you should always remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | What this does! |\n",
    "|------|---------------------|\n",
    "|  \\+  |  Addition           |\n",
    "|  \\-  |  Subtraction        |\n",
    "|  \\*  |  Multiplication     |\n",

    "|   %  |  Modulo or remainder|\n",
    "|  //  |  Floor division     |  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Importing packages conventions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "\n",
    "   import package  #import an entire package and access its element with a .some_package()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   import package as pk # give your package a nickname\n",
    "\n",
    "   from package import a_function # import a specific instance of that package you want/need\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Installing packages. Remember to use a `!` before a shell command when installing a package from a notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell  \n",
    "\n",
    "   pip install package # Python's own package manager\n",
    "   conda install -c anaconda statsmodels # Anaconda's package manager\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Loops help us do tasks repeatedly. The `a_var` below can be any word or letter we'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    for a_var in a_list:\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Something to do all a_var's\n",
    "        inside a_list    \n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        print(a_var)\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "9. `if-else` statements allow us to do operations based on logical statements that evaluate to True or False.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    if 2 + 2 == 4:\n",
    "        print(\"Yay, I knew it :)\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Oopss, let me revisit this one first\")\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "10. Functions help us save time by allowing us to package simple-to-complex operations into one place. They follow the DRY convention, which stands for \"Don't Repeat Yourself.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def do_something_cool(name, age): # here you define your function and the inputs it should take\n",
    "        print(f\"My name is {name}\") # here\n",
    "        new_age = age + 1 # and here\n",
    "        print(f\"and next year I will be {new_age} years old!\") # and here, you do something with your inputs\n",
    "        \n",
    "    do_something_cool(name=\"Natasha\", age=35) # now test your function with some data\n",

    "Numpy stands for Numerical Python and is one of the core libraries for everything that is related to data analysis in Python. In fact, it is so important for the entire data analytics and data science ecosystem, that most of the libraries and packages we will see in later lessons (and that you will continue to see later in your career) will most likely depend, in one way or another, on NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This versatile library allows to do fast and efficient computations with arrays and matrices as well as simple-to-complex mathematical calculations. One of the reasons why it is so powerful and fast is that it is written on top libraries that interact with some functionalities of the C programming language. This means that they are executed much closer to the hardware of our computers than the regular lists in Python. We will compare the speed of both, lists and numpy arrays, later in this lesson to understand better what sets the apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Characteristics of NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many built-in mathematical functions\n",
    "- Efficient computations with n-dimensional arrays (n is the number of dimensions)\n",
    "- Fast\n",
    "- It allows for broadcasting. This is the equivalent computation of a loop but without the loop. Meaning, for a lot of tasks with large datasets, you won't need to create a loop\n",
    "- Arrays use less of your computer memory than built-in Python equivalent data types and structures\n",
    "- Excellent tool for generating random data. This will be useful if you would like to simulate different scenarios with post-marketing campaign sales, stock prices, weather impact on agricultural production, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's beging by importing our library with its industry alias (remember, an alias is the nickname you give to the modules you import). The community using Python for data analysis has adopted the convention of importing NumPy as `np`, and to make collaborating easier and save us typing unnecessary letters, we will follow this convention."

    "1. Lists in Python can be treated as the arrays and matrices that will hold our data for us. The are extremely powerful and versatile data structures and they can be used in almost every aspect of the data analytics cycle that includes analysis.\n",
    "2. NumPy is a library of code built on top of the programming language C. This particular characteristic allows it to communicate with the hardware of our machines and run our computations very, very fast.\n",
    "3. When possible, use broadcasting instead of loop in order to optimise your code and time.\n",
    "4. Generating random data allows us to test models and functions very fast and numpy can help us very well with this. It has functions such as `np.ones`, `np.random.random`, `np.linspace`, and many more.\n",
    "5. Masking is a type of filtering method that allows us to have a closer look at our data. It is, in a way, an equivalent way of constructing if-else statements.\n",
    "6. List comprehensions are a type of for loop that gives us the ability to generate a list from repeated commands."
